# Templates

Various project templates. These are intended to be used with [PQS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@basementuniverse/pqs). If you want to use them without PQS, you can copy the files you need and ignore/delete `pqs.config.js`.

After cloning this repo, create the following file:

`~/.pqs.config.json`

```json
{
  "templateLocations": [
    "~/Projects/templates"
  ]
}
```

(replace the path with wherever you cloned this repo)

Then you can run `pqs` from anywhere and use the templates in this repo.
